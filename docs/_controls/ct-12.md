title: Data Access Control for RAG-Enhanced AI Models  
---

- Ensure data provided by Confluence is aligned with the end-user role
- For data stored in encrypted file system, before a model/user/system tries to process and train/retrive the data, it has to prove its authentication, either through hardware-based or software-based attestation 

Implement a multi-layered access control system for the RAG knowledge base, incorporating RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC, and CBAC methodologies:
a) Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define clear roles and their associated permissions within the RAG system.
b) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Utilize user, resource, action, and context attributes to make fine-grained access decisions.
c) Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC): Consider the relationships between users and resources when determining access rights.
d) Context-Based Access Control (CBAC): Evaluate the context of both requests and responses to prevent unauthorized data exposure.
 
Ensure that data provided by the knowledge base for RAG is aligned with the user's role, attributes, relationships, and context.
 Implement authentication mechanisms:
a) Require multi-factor authentication for access to highly confidential, HIPAA-protected, and PCI data.
b) Support both hardware-based and software-based attestation methods for AI model authentication.
c) Authenticate before any AI model can retrieve or process data from the knowledge base during RAG operations.
 
Data classification and metadata tagging:
a) Classify all data in the RAG knowledge base according to sensitivity levels.
b) Tag vectors and documents with appropriate metadata including allowed roles, attributes, and relationships.
c) Implement end-to-end encryption for all highly confidential, HIPAA-protected, and PCI data within the RAG system.
 
Query processing and filtering:
a) Implement a query processing system that checks user credentials against data classifications and metadata before retrieval.
b) Apply fine-grained access control at the document or vector level in the search/retrieval process.
c) Filter query results based on the user's access rights before returning information to the RAG model.

Continuous monitoring and auditing:
a) Implement logging and monitoring systems to track all data access attempts during RAG operations.
b) Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specific to the RAG system's handling of sensitive data.
c) Implement real-time alerts for any suspicious access attempts to highly confidential data.
 
Data Governance and Use Case Approval:
a) Establish a Data Council responsible for overseeing the use of data in RAG-enhanced AI systems.
b) Implement a formal use case approval process for all RAG applications, especially those involving highly confidential, HIPAA-protected, or PCI data.
c) Maintain a registry of approved use cases, including details on data types used, access levels, and purpose.
d) Require periodic re-certification of approved use cases to ensure ongoing relevance and compliance.
 
Training and awareness:
a) Provide specialized training for personnel handling RAG systems with access to sensitive data.
b) Implement ongoing awareness programs about the importance of data classification and proper handling of sensitive information in AI systems.
 
Regular review and updates:
a) Periodically review and update access control policies to adapt to changing organizational needs and emerging security threats.
b) Ensure that the access control system remains compatible with updates to the RAG architecture and underlying AI models.
 Integration with existing security infrastructure:
a) Ensure that the RAG access control system integrates seamlessly with the organization's existing identity and access management (IAM) systems.
b) Align RAG access control policies with overall organizational security policies and compliance requirements.
By implementing this comprehensive control, organizations can significantly enhance the security of their RAG-enhanced AI systems, ensuring that sensitive data is protected while maintaining the flexibility and power of RAG for authorized users and use cases.
